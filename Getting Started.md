# Getting Started

Getting started might be daunting but there are plenty of resources and online communities to support and encourage your development

If you are curious about... 

* what is software?
* what is a program?
* how do we get from 1's and 0's to pictures, video games, zip files?

...you are in the right place

## Guide

* take courses, a good place to start are the [courses](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/Getting%20Started.md#courses)
    * ideally you need a class in data structures, algorithms, and a programming class
    * try coding data structures, algorithms, or experiment with the concepts yourself
