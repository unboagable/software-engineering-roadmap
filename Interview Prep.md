## Advice and Tips

* [picking a language to interview in](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/contents/picking-a-language.md)
* spend a couple of hours research company culture, industry, and product
  * company's website, company's wikipedia article, [glassdoor reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm)
* spend a couple days (2-3) studying the subject matter and CS fundamentals
  * [data structures](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/computer%20science%20review/Data%20Structures/Data%20Structures.md), object-oriented design, and [algorithms](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/computer%20science%20review/Algorithms/Algorithms.md)
  * ex: [arrays](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/computer%20science%20review/Primitives/Arrays/Arrays.md), [(O)n](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/), binary trees, link list, integers, hash map, traversals, recursions, etc.
  * go back to your college textbooks
  * pick your favorite data structure and implement it
* spend a week or 2 practicing problems and practicing mock interviews
* line up interviews in rounds so you can pace yourself and improve
  * line up easier or companies your less interested in earlier so you can build momentum and confidence for the interviews you really care about
  * practice while applying then set interviews 2-3 weeks outs to study and get in the zone
* [checklist right before the interview](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/contents/cheatsheet.md#before-interview)
* explore roles adjacent to software engineering
